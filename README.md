# Book Wishlist app

## Overview

This is a book wishlist app where users can keep track and create lists of books categorized in any way they want, whether it be to rank their favorite books or keep a wishlist of books to buy.

## Motivation

I made this app because a few years ago, I worked on a school project in college for my software design and architecture course. 
I was tasked with architecting a workflow for a desktop program that had a defined relational schema relationship. 
For this assignment, I was developing a bookstore IMS that would keep track of inventory of books. However, the problems with the previous project was as follows:

- It was left incomplete. The project was never finished due to time constraints and incompetence on my part when designing the architecture because in order for the workflow to work, the app would have to be hosted live and used by other people but I only managed to write the logic for listing test entries of records. 

After I completed the course, I left the school project alone for a few years until recently when I began to take an interest in Ruby on Rails again. I thought this project which was non-functional and unpolished would benefit from a do-over but with technology that is more suited for production and fits my workflow better.
